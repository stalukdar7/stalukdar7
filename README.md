### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm Shaon Talukdar (he/him) and I'm a Sophmore at the University of British Columbia. As an undergraduate student studying Computer Science and Business in a joint program between the Sauder School of Business and the Department of Computer Science, I'm fascinated by the correlation of Computing Models and their possibilities in Business. Currently, I'm still shaping my interests and building on them but have used my existing skills to develop games, create this website, and participate in hackathons. Additionally, I am exploring courses and developing interests on either side as well as transfusing skills across business and computer science but I do hope to work on something extremely meaningful sometime soon which I can come back here and write about!
